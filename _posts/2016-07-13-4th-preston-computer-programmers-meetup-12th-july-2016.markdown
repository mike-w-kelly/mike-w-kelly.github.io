We celebrated our 6 month anniversary last night with 9 programmers in attendance.

The format for the meetup was lean coffee; where we all came up with some topics to discuss, voted on them and then talked through them over coffee and biscuits.

## What did we discuss

### Mob Programming
Simon has read about [Mob programming](http://mobprogramming.org/) and was interested in seeing if any of us had
tried it, and/or what our thoughts on it were

- like pair programming but for larger groups
- teams of 5-12
- could work for solving requirements issues
- brainstorming with code
	
### Coding Kata
I (Mike) was interested in other developers techniques for improving and retaining knowledge of 
programming languages. In martial arts they have Kata, a set of moves that are practised to
perfection to re-enforce techniques and to commit them to muscle memory. Is there something similar
for programmers?

- [The Art of Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1468397376&sr=1-1&keywords=the+art+of+unit+testing)
  - TDD Kata
- Codewars.com 
- Design Patterns
- Common language for programmers

### TDD Usage in the real world
Nick was interested in our experiences using TDD commercially 

- Continuous Integration, automating all the things
- Test coverage
- Refactoring old code base
- Who should be writing tests > BDD, Specflow
- Being asked in interview then never using on the job
- First thing to get axed when time is short, false economy?

### Machine Learning any practical applications?
Dan is learning it at the moment via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) and University of Washington

- All just statistics
- Big Data
- Amazon reviews. sentiment analysers

### .Net Core, ASP.net 5/6 discuss migrating projects
Sean is rewriting an old web-forms app with [.Net core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows)

- Cross Platform
- seems to just work
- Developed in VS2015

### DevOps with Docker is anyone using it
Graham is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for a new product he's developing to make deployments easier

- Eases deployments
- Stephen is using for development and quickly spinning up dev environments on Macbook Pro, but not using in production
- Concerns over database changes, Docker scripts the answer

### Hybrid Mobile Web Apps
I (Mike) was interested in peoples views on Mobile apps build with web tech vs native applications
and what issues, if any people have faced with both approaches.

- Native may be better for performance
- If not a polished experience don't bother
- [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) app slow
- Android UI easier than iOS
- Just ship it, users don't care so long as it works

### Brexit - Good or Bad for programmers
Simon was interested on how we all saw Brexit with regards to how we get work in the future

- Could create opportunities for contractors as per 2008 with freeze on perm hiring
- Could limit opportunities as finance puts investment on hold
- If London stops being a startup hub will the opportunities move to EU, Germany etc
- Limit opportunity for contracts in EU etc
- Could it help re-balance the economy and move focus away from London to places like Manchester
- Basically a big question no one knows the answer to.
	
## Take homes

- Format is good, gets everyone involved lots of information shared
- More new faces
- Move time to 7pm for next one to make it easier for people to attend
- Arrange a more social component either for after lean coffee or on another night so people can meet and chat
- Could look at doing a Mob programming session at a meetup as an experiment, possibly with a coding kata

Link to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rmpzM8lz/preston-computer-programmers) with the cards on, if you want to add any details or links please feel free.

## Summary

Another good meetup with 4 new faces, good variety of topics discussed and a lot of further reading to do.

All future meetups will be hash tagged on twitter with [#prestonprogrammers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/prestonprogrammers) if you want to keep up to date outside of Meetup.
