My name is Mike Kelly. I'm a programmer, cloud native engineer, scrum master and ux designer. I work remotely out of my home office in Preston, Lancashire (England). I'm currently working as a Senior Cloud Native Engineer at Fujitsu. This blog and its content and opinions are solely mine.

Background
----------
I've been working commercially in programming since 2004, getting my start with AXA Insurance. For the last 10 years prior to joining Fujitsu I was an independant contractor via my own limited company. These days I'm a consultant engineer working with all things Cloud Native, mostly in Azure with a little bit of AWS thrown in for variety.
